# Azure in Green Tech
Azure believes sustainability and humanity’s response to climate change as one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime. Hence, it has plans for greener future through introducing sustainable technologies. Azure has pledged to put sustainable technology at the centre of our innovation, ensuring that we adapt and grow in lockstep with the earth while minimising environmental effect.
## Water Usage

On average, data centers use 3-5 million gallons of water every day which is equivalent to the water usage of a city with 30,000 to 50,000 people. Water is primarily used in data centers for cooling the servers and in the generation of non-renewable electricity.

### Azure towards water positivity

Microsoft aims at drastically reducing its water usage in data centers by 95% by 2024. It also aims at going water positive by 2030.

#### Warmer Temperature

A typical data center requires its temperature to be in the range of 68 to 71 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain optimal performance. Microsoft is investing its time and resources in enabling its data centers to work at warmer temperatures. It could potentially reduce the usage of water for cooling. The data center in Dublin can withstand and run effectively up to 95 degrees.

#### Liquid Immersion

It is a process of cooling the hardware by directly immersing it into a non-conductive, dielectric coolant. It can replace the usage of water for cooling and hence save water. It is also a sustainable and greener method for cooling. Microsoft is continuing its research on liquid immersion. Microsoft has also run a two-phase liquid immersion cooling in a production environment.

#### Underwater and Submerged Data Centers

About half the world's population lives by the coast. Setting-up data centers near coastal cities would mean data has to travel a shorter distance, leading to fast and smooth web surfing, video streaming, and game playing. These data centers also are consistently under the cool subsurface seas that increase energy efficiency. It was observed that the failure rate of the hardware was only 1/8th of that on the land.


### Azure towards Reforestation

#### How Azure helped The Nature Conservancy

Technology aided in putting the company on a more meaningful path. The Nature Conservancy has adopted Microsoft Azure cloud services, which is changing the way the organisation tackles conservation planning—and resulting in real-world impact (or, in some cases, in the water). The Nature Conservancy was able to use an innovative approach that combined traditional academic research with big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and social media inputs to map the full value of coral reefs to tourism in high resolution, highlighting the incentive for sustainable reef management, thanks to a long-term partnership with Microsoft.
